## Overview
New York City CitiBike data from August 2019 was analyzed to show trends for times of day, days of the week, gender, starting locations, and ending locations. This analysis required analysts to used Pandas to change the 'tripduration' column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Using the converted datatype, visualizations were created to show the length of time the bikes are checkout for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, top starting locations, and top ending locations.
